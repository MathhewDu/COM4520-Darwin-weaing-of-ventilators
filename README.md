The folder Model contains the model and the Dataloader. The folder Data contains the data pre-process file.

Use the Data/data_preprocess.ipynb to get processed dataset(windows_df_360.csv and windows_df_360_last.csv).

Move the two datasets generated to the Model folder, then run Model/Model.ipynb or Model/Model.py to run the system.
